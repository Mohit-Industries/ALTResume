# Personal Website 2017

First personal website I created, around 2017. Discoverd some beautiful websites on awwwwards.com and used them all as inspiration to create this minimal, dark, portfolio website, where I shared my current work, my reading list and engineering projects that I worked on.

I've since deployed another personal website, which you can find [here](https://www.abdelshokair.tech)

But there is still value in file, mainly the reading list that I had back then. If anyone is reading this at some point in time and wants to a few other books to their [tsundoky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku), here it is:

## Reading List:

- My name is Red, by Orhan Pamuk
- Man's Search For Meaning, by Viktor Frankl
- Season of Migration to the North, by Tayeb Salih
- The Idiot, by Fyodor Dostoevsky
