# Personal Website 2018

First personal website I created, around 2018. I discovered some beautiful websites on [awwwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com) and used them as inspiration to create this minimalistic, dark, portfolio website, where I displayed my work, my reading list and the engineering projects that I worked on.

I've since deployed another personal website, which you can find [here](https://www.abdelshokair.tech).

There is still value in this file though. I'm specifically talking about the reading list I included back then. If anyone is reading this at some point in time, anywhere in the world, and wants to a add a few other books to their [tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku), here it is.

In a way, these books can all tell you a little bit (or a lot) about me :)

## Reading List:

- My name is Red, by Orhan Pamuk
- Man's Search For Meaning, by Viktor Frankl
- Season of Migration to the North, by Tayeb Salih
- The Idiot, by Fyodor Dostoevsky
